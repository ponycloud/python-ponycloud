simple_disk_placement:
  about: |
    Place two disks on a host based on the change of the respective
    host_disk rows.  All participating rows exist.

  steps:
    - update:
        - [host, host1, desired, {uuid: host1}]
        - [disk, disk1, desired, {id: disk1, size: 1024, storage_pool: null}]
        - [disk, disk2, desired, {id: disk2, size: 1024, storage_pool: null}]

      expect:
        host1:
          - [host, host1]

    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, {host: host1, disk: disk1}]
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, {host: host1, disk: disk2}]

minimal_disk_placement:
  about: |
    Place two disks on a host based on the change of the respective
    host_disk rows.  The corresponding host and disk rows do not exist,
    so the placement should not work.

  steps:
    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, {host: host1, disk: disk1}]
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, {host: host1, disk: disk2}]

      expect:
        host1: []

    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, null]
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, null]

      expect: {}
