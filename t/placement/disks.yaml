simple_disk_placement:
  about: |
    Place two disks on a host based on the change of the respective
    host_disk rows.  All participating rows exist.

  steps:
    - host:
        - desired:
            uuid: host1

      disk:
        - desired:
            id: disk1
            size: 1024
            storage_pool: null

        - desired:
            id: disk2
            size: 1024
            storage_pool: null

    - host_disk:
        - current:
            host: host1
            disk: disk1
        - current:
            host: host1
            disk: disk2

  expect:
    host1:
      - [host, host1]
      - [disk, disk1]
      - [disk, disk2]


minimal_disk_placement:
  about: |
    Place two disks on a host based on the change of the respective
    host_disk rows.  The corresponding host and disk rows do not exist,
    but the placement should work regardless.

  steps:
    - host_disk:
        - current:
            host: host1
            disk: disk1
        - current:
            host: host1
            disk: disk2

  expect:
    host1:
      - [disk, disk1]
      - [disk, disk2]
