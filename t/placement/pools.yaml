  about: |
    We provide all disks, their storage pool, host configuration and
    expect the storage pool to be placed on the host along with the disks.

  steps:
    - update:
        - [storage_pool, pool, desired, {uuid: pool}]
        - [disk, disk1, desired, {id: disk1, storage_pool: pool, size: 1024}]
        - [disk, disk2, desired, {id: disk2, storage_pool: pool, size: 1024}]
        - [host, host1, desired, {uuid: host1}]
        - [host, host2, desired, {uuid: host2}]

      expect:
        host1:
          - [host, host1]

        host2:
          - [host, host2]

    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, {host: host1, disk: disk1}]
        - [host_disk, [host2, disk1], current, {host: host2, disk: disk1}]

      expect:
        host1:
          - [host, host1]
          - [disk, disk1]

        host2:
          - [host, host2]
          - [disk, disk1]

    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, {host: host1, disk: disk2}]

      expect:

        - [host_disk, [host2, disk2], current, {host: host2, disk: disk2}]

        - [host, host1, desired, null]

      expect:
