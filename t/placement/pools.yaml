  about: |
    We provide all disks, their storage pool, host configuration and
    expect the storage pool to be placed on the host along with the disks.

  steps:
    # Add everything except host disks.
    - update:
        - [storage_pool, pool, desired, {uuid: pool}]
        - [disk, disk1, desired, {id: disk1, storage_pool: pool, size: 1024}]
        - [disk, disk2, desired, {id: disk2, storage_pool: pool, size: 1024}]
        - [host, host1, desired, {uuid: host1}]
        - [host, host2, desired, {uuid: host2}]

      expect:
        host1: &empty_host1
          - [host, host1]

        host2: &empty_host2
          - [host, host2]

    # Add some host disks, resulting in storage pools and all disks being
    # placed on those hosts.
    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, {host: host1, disk: disk1}]
        - [host_disk, [host2, disk1], current, {host: host2, disk: disk1}]

      expect:
        host1: &full_host1
          - [host, host1]
          - [disk, disk1]
          - [disk, disk2]
          - [storage_pool, pool]

        host2: &full_host2
          - [host, host2]
          - [disk, disk1]
          - [disk, disk2]
          - [storage_pool, pool]

    # Add more host disks, observing that nothing have changed.
    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, {host: host1, disk: disk2}]
        - [host_disk, [host2, disk2], current, {host: host2, disk: disk2}]

      expect:
        host1: *full_host1
        host2: *full_host2

    # Remove both hosts disks of a single host, resulting in that host
    # losing both storage pool and disk configurations.
    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk1], current, null]
        - [host_disk, [host1, disk2], current, null]

      expect:
        host1: *empty_host1
        host2: *full_host2

    # Remove all remaining host disks and host configurations, observing
    # completely empty placement on both hosts, although the disks and
    # storage pool still exist in the configuration.
    - update:
        - [host_disk, [host2, disk1], current, null]
        - [host_disk, [host2, disk2], current, null]
        - [host, host1, desired, null]
        - [host, host2, desired, null]

      expect: {}

    # Just in case, clean up the hosts and storage pool and observe that we
    # still have nothing placed.
    - update:
        - [disk, disk1, desired, null]
        - [disk, disk2, desired, null]
